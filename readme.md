##The Distribution of African Elephants
**By Hannah Wright**
<p> This project is a depiction of the distribution of African Elephants according to the percentage present by country in 2015 to go along with a World Wildlife Fund article regarding the status of African Elephants. I created a chloropleth map with interaction allowing the user to mouse-over each country and view the name and the percentage of elephants present. I also included a section including information about African Elephants along with information from the WWF article to give the user some background. I made sure to include a descriptive title, and I added a legend that shows the percentage correlating with each color on the map. I moved the legend directly underneath the hover section to illustrate that the different color grades represent percentages and I made sure to place my source information along with my name in the bottom right corner. </p>
